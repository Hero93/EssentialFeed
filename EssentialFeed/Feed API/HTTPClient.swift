// There's no reason to make the HTTPClient a singleton, apart from convenience to locate the instace directly.
// It doesn't need to be a class either, it is just a contract defining which external functionality the "RemoteFeedLoader" needs.

// We don't need to create a new type to conform to it, we can easily create an extension on URLSession or Alamofire.

// It's public because it can be implemented by external modules
