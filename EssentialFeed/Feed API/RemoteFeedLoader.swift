// There's no reason to make the HTTPClient a singleton, apart from convenience to locate the instace directly.
// It doesn't need to be a class either, it is just a contract defining which external functionality the "RemoteFeedLoader" needs.

// We don't need to create a new type to conform to it, we can easily create an extension on URLSession or Alamofire.

// It's public because it can be implemented by external modules

// "RemoteFeedLoader" will not depend on concrete type like URLSession but by creating a clean separation between protocols,
// we make the RemoteFeedLoader more flexible, open for extensions and more testable.

// It's public because it can be implemented and created by external modules

    // We can make our code more modular, by injecting the HTTPClient as a dependency. (Open/Close principle)
    
    // Usually the HTTPClient is created as a Singleton -> by doing this I introduce high coupoling between the modules.
