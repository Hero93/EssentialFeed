// It doesn't need to be a class either, it is just a contract defining which external functionality the "RemoteFeedLoader" needs.

// We don't need to create a new type to conform to it, we can easily create an extension on URLSession or Alamofire.

// It's public because it can be implemented by external modules

// we make the RemoteFeedLoader more flexible, open for extensions and more testable.
